**Jekyll Serve** provides Task integration with the Jekyll serve, build, and clean commands.

Jekyll Serve integrates common Jekyll commands into the standard Nova task workflow, providing one-click or keyboard shortcut access to quickly perform these actions on your site.

## Usage

Add the extension to your Jekyll project as a task by:
- Select the **Project > Tasks > Edit Taskâ€¦** menu item.
- Click the plus button in the **Tasks** header in the sidebar
- Select **Jekyll Serve** 

After adding the extension, you can now use the built-in Nova commands for your Jekyll project:

Run: `jekyll serve`  
Build: `jekyll build`  
Clean: `jekyll clean`

For full details on invoking actions in Nova, see [Invoking Actions](https://help.panic.com/nova/run-tasks/#invoking-actions) in the Nova Library.

### Configuration

You can customize many options, such as whether draft or unpublished posts are published.

Most options are fully explained in the extension interface but a few need a bit of further discussion:

#### Task Report
When configuring the JekyllServe task, selecting **On Run** from the **Open report** popup-menu will open a pane showing the log of the task running.

For the Run command, the text will include a clickable URL to the served Jekyll site.

#### Use 'bundle exec'
This option runs each command in the context of a Bundler bundle:  
`bundle exec jekyll serve`

Turn off this option to run the commands directly:  
`jekyll serve`

Because jekyll commands are often run using `bundle exec` this option is enabled by default.

#### Host
Using the local hostname of your computer, such as `mycomputer.local`, allows you to test your Jekyll site on other local devices, such as mobile devies.

You can find the local hostname of your Mac in the Sharing section of System Settings.

#### Port
If you edit multiple Jekyll site projects, setting a different port for each allows you to easily serve multiple sites simultaneously without conflicting ports.

## Ruby Version
Jekyll projects often include a `.ruby-version` file to specify the version of ruby to be used. Gems used by the project, including Jekyll itself, are installed for a particular version of ruby.

JekyllServe uses an included copy of chruby to run tasks using the specified version of ruby and to ensure the correct set of gems is available.

The standard ruby installation paths used by common ruby version managers, chruby, RVM, rbenv, and rbfu, are searched for ruby versions if present.

Since Jekyll projects typically do require a particular version of ruby, adding a `.ruby-version` file is recommended for use with JekyllServe.
